# Weather App

A simple React.js weather application that fetches real-time weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API.
The app allows users to search for any city and view the current temperature and weather conditions â€” all with a dark modern UI built using Tailwind CSS.

---

## How It Works

1. The user enters a city name and clicks Search.
2. The app sends a request to the OpenWeatherMap API using fetch().
3. The API returns weather data in JSON format.
4. React updates the state and displays:
    - City Name
    - Temperature (Â°C)
    - Weather Description
5.If the city is invalid, an error message appears..
